### Surprise Gift App:

The Surprise Gift App is a mobile platform designed to simplify gift selection, save time, and make shopping more enjoyable. The app provides personalized gift suggestions based on the user's budget and preferences. Users can fill out a short survey about the recipient to help the system choose the best options.

The app's most striking feature is its emphasis on surprise. Users can opt for the system to choose the gift for them, making the gift's contents a mystery, even for the giver. This turns the shopping process into an exciting and mysterious experience for both the giver and the receiver.

Additionally, users can receive reminders about upcoming special days to help them plan their gift shopping in advance. The app solves issues like indecision in gift selection, time loss, and budgeting difficulties with smart suggestions and a user-friendly interface.

### Key Features:

- *User Management*: Account creation, profile updates, password changes.
- *Address & Shipment Tracking*: Managing address information and tracking shipment statuses.
- *Special Day Management*: Users can add their special days and view upcoming ones.
- *Surveys*: Users can participate in surveys.
- *Notifications*: Sending personalized notifications to users.

This project is developed using React Native and the Expo framework, providing a user-friendly interface to offer a practical, fun, and surprising shopping experience.
